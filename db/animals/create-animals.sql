They are listed as critically endangered by the IUCN with the population estimated at roughly 250-340 adult individuals as of 2013 with the population declining. Habitat loss and illegal wildlife poaching are the leading causes of the declining population.', 'The Malayan Tiger is the most recently recognized subspecies and the national animal of Malaysia. Until a few years ago it was considered the same subspecies as the Indochina tiger, but based on the genetic analysis it was discovered that they are different. Panthera tigris jacksoni emerged as a subspecies in 2004. Its scientific name comes from the tiger conservationist Peter Jackson, but in the Malay language, it is called Harimau or just Rimau.', 'The Malayan Tigers are much smaller than the tigers that live in India. A male measures about 102 inches and females about 94 inches in length. They are a very powerful predator that feeds on muntjacs, sambars, tapirs, and more. The Malayan Tiger usually hunts alone but can hunt in a group if necessary.', 'Females will usually have 2-5 cubs that they care for until the age of 18 months where the cubs become independent. The Cincinnati Zoo and Botanical Garden was the first to start a breeding program for these tigers. The latest successful breeding was in Nov. 14, 2017 at the Prague Zoo in the Czech Republic', 3);
